= TODO
* Code refinement. 
* replace "doc/gd-intro_ja.html" with some manual. This document
  should be maintained in other place.
* Implement a class that enables easy string handling.
* remove some functions in GD.c that are not necessarily to be 
  coded by C. Polygon object may be implemented with Ruby script.
